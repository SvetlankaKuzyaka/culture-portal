In their work all kinds of stage art were synthesized - dramatic, musical, vocal, dance, circus, pop.

It functioned in many cities and towns at Catholic and Orthodox theological educational institutions. So, in Minsk at the end of the 17th century a theater arose under the Jesuit College. Plots for the theater were borrowed from the Bible, and performances were staged exclusively on religious topics. Batleyka puppet theater enjoyed even greater popularity and popular love.",
